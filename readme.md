Simple scripts I wrote in python that i found helpful in personal life and at uni
## Contents

- **CodeToMarkodown**: extracts the source codes from a folder of exercises and it displays them all in a nice and well-formatted Markdown file to simplify revising.
     - It removes the comments from the code, and displays them as an unordered list on which is useful if you pasted the assignment in a comment in the file

-  **ColorCorrectPDFS**: helps you color correcting pdfs, even handwritten notes if you want to print them. Transforms a pdf into images and color corrects pixel by pixel. Then you can print them in pdf alltogether as you like
